# SVM_Salary
Support Vector Machines (SVM) in a salary dataset for machine learning involves using this algorithm to predict salary based on various features such as education level, years of experience, job title, etc. SVM works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data points into different classes or salary categories. It aims to maximize the margin between the hyperplane and the nearest data points of each class. This allows SVM to effectively classify new instances into the appropriate salary category based on their feature values. By training the SVM on the salary dataset, it learns to generalize from the provided data and make accurate predictions about salary levels for unseen instances.
